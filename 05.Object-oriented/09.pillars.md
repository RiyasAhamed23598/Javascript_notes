# Pillars of Object oriented programming

## Encapsulation

- Bundling data and methods(that operate on data) in a single unit which represents a real world entity.

## Abstraction

- Hiding the internal complexities from the user and showing only the essential features of an object.
- Can be achieved with private methods.

## Inheritence

- Shared data and methods can be moved to a super class to promote code reusability.
- We also save memory by having shared methods and prototype chains.

## Polymorphism

- Every sub class can have their own implementation of a method.
- Like area method for circle will be different than area method on rectangle class.
- Many forms of a same function.
- Overloading as each method can have different parameters
