# Pillars of Object oriented programming

## Encapsulation

- Bundling data and methods(that operate on data) in a single unit which represents a real world entity.

## Abstraction

- Hiding the internal complexities from the user and showing only the essential features of an object.
- Can be achieved with private methods.

## Inheritence

- Shared data and methods can be moved to a super class to promote code reusability.
- We also save memory by having shared methods and prototype chains.
