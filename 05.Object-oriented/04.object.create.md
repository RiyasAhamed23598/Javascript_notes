# Object.create

- Object.create takes two arguments and return a new object.
- New object's prototype is set to the object in the first argument.
- If we want to add some properties to the newly created object, we can pass an object as second argumnet.


 ## How did it solve the problem of duplicacy with factory functions

 - We can create a common store object which contains all the methods of a class.
 - These methods are stored in the memory at one place.
 - Everytime a new object is created we set it's prototype to store object.
