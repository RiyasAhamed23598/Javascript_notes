# Factory functions

- These are the functions that returns an object.
- Everytime this function is called, a new object is returned.
- To initialise state, we pass arguments to these factory functions.

## Limitation

- Method duplicacy. The same methods defined in the factory function, will be copeied to a memory location for every new object created.
- Inefficient memory allocation
