# Inheritence

- We have two classes superclass and a subclass or a generalised entity and specialised entity.
- If we see that two real world entities have a lot in common, we can pll away all shared details to a base class.
- We do this using `extends` keyword.

## Super

- We have a superclass and a subclass.
- They both have their constructors to add properties to the intances.
- The final object will have properties from both the classes. So, we need to call constructors of both the classes.
- So, inside the constructor of base class we use `super` to invoke constructor of parent.
