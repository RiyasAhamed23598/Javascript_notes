# Constructor functions

- Constrcutor functions are used to create objects.
- They are like normal functions except
- They create a new object.
- Whatever properties are declred with `this` keyword are added to this new object.
- __ proto __ of this object refers to ConstructorFunction.Prototype.
- It returns this nw object without using the return keyword.
- Whenever we create an instance of constructor functions, the instance has access to constructor function's prototype.
- __proto __ of the instance points to constructor function's prototype.This way we can share methods across instances.
- Any function that is invoked using the new keyword is a constructor function.
- Number, Object, Array, Function, String, Boolean etc are all constructor functions.
- Constructor functions should start with a capital letter to distinguish from normal functions.
