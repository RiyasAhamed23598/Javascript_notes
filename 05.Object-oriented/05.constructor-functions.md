# Constructor functions

- Constrcutor functions are used to create objects.
- They are like normal functions except
- They create a new object.
- Whatever properties are declared with `this` keyword are added to this new object.
- __ proto __ of this object refers to ConstructorFunction.Prototype.
- It returns this new object without using the return keyword.
- Constructor functions are invoked using the `new` keyword.
- Number, Object, Array, Function, String, Boolean etc are all constructor functions.
- Constructor functions should start with a capital letter to distinguish from normal functions.
