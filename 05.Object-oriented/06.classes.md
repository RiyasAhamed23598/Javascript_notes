# Classes 

## Why

- The prototypes are confusing. Using constructor functions, `new` keyword, `this` etc requires deep knowledge of working with prototypes.
- Other languages like Java follows classical object oriented patterns.
- Classes were introduced in ES6 to simplify onject creation and object oriented programming in JS.
