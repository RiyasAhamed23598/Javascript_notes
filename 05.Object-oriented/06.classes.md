# Classes 

## Why

- We want to follow object oriented programming patterns.
- But to do so we have to deal with `prototypes`, `constructor functions`, `this`, `new` which looks complicated.
- To simplify object oriented programming, classes were introduced in JS in `ES6`.
- Behind the scenes JS is still using constructor functions and classes are just a syntactic sugar.

## What

- To add unique properties to an instance, we use a `constructor` which runs everytime we create an `instance` of class.
- Methods are not added to the constructor because they are meant to be shared by all the instances.
