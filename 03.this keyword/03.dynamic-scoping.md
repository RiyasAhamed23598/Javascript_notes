# Dynamic scoping

- We learned about lexical scope earlier.
- That a scope of function is determined by where it is written and not how it is invoked.
- But `this` keyword does not follow lexical scoping. It follows dynamic scoping.
- The value of `this` depends on how we invoke a function and not where it is written.
