# Dynamic scoping

- We learned about lexical scope earlier.
- That a scope of function is determined by where it is written and not how it is invoked.
- But `this` keyword does not follow lexical scoping. It follows dynamic scoping.
- The value of `this` depends on how we invoke a function and not where it is written.

## Problems with dynamic scoping

- In regular functions, the value of this depends on how the function is called.
- In an object method: this refers to the object.
- In standalone functions or callbacks: this can be undefined (in strict mode) or refer to the global object.

``` javascript

function Person() {
  this.age = 0;

  setInterval(function growUp() {
    this.age++;
    console.log(this.age); // 'this' refers to the global object (or undefined in strict mode)
  }, 1000);
}

const p = new Person();

```

``` javascript

const obj = {
  name: "John",
  email: "John@gmail.com",
  a() {
    console.log("a", this);

    function b() {
      console.log("b", this);
    }

    b();
  },
};

```
