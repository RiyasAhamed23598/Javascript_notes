# How this keyword works

- We have a function and we want to know what `this` would refer to inside that function.
- `this` would refer to the object which function is a property of.
- If we have a function, try to determine which object this function is a property of and `this` would refer to that object.


## Example 1

``` javascript

function a() {
  console.log(this); // window
}

```

Here, function a is a property of global object (window). Hence, `this` would refer to window object.
