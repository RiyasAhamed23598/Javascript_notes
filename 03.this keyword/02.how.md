# How this keyword works

- We have a function and we want to know what `this` would refer to inside that function.
- `this` would refer to the object which function is a property of.
- If we have a function, try to determine which object this function is a property of and `this` would refer to that object.
- Since, function is a property of an object, we would invoke it like obj.myFunc, So a rule of thumb can be whatever is to the left of dot, `this` would refer to it. Or who is calling the function, `this` would refer to that.


## Example 1

``` javascript

function a() {
  console.log(this); // window
}

```

Here, function a is a property of global object (window). Hence, `this` would refer to window object.

## Example 2

``` javascript

let person = {
  id: 1,
  name: "John",
  greetUser() {
    console.log(this.name);
  },
};

person.greetUser();

```

Here, function greetUser is a property of person object. Hence, `this` would refer to person object.

## Example 3

``` javascript

function a() {
  'use strict';
  console.log(this); // undefined
}

```

## Nested functions and this

- We learned that `this` refers to who called the function or an object that function is property of.
- But what about nested functions. They are not property of any object and neither on global object.
- So, how do we determine the value of `this` inside nested functions?

``` javascript

function a() {
  console.log("a", this); // window

  function b() {
    console.log("b", this); // window

    const c = {
      hi() {
        console.log("c", this); // c
      },
    };

    c.hi();
  }

  b();
}

a();

```

- Who called b? Nobody. There's no object that b is a property of. So, it will take global object as it's value.
- Whenever a function is not property of any object or nobody called it, `this` refers to the window.
