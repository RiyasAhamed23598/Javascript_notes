# this keyword

## Why do we need it

- Inside a function, I want a variable that can refer to different objects depending upon how this function is invoked.
- One way can be to pass objects explicitly as arguments and then assign it to a variable.
- `this` keyword provides a dynamic context to our functions. Depending on how we invoke a function, we can have different values of this inside same function which helps in reusability.

## 1. Accessing Object Properties Inside Methods

``` javascript

const person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  greet() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}`; // `this` refers to the `person` object
  }
};
console.log(person.greet()); // "Hello, my name is Alice"

```

- But, I can also do `person.name` so, what problem does `this` solves here ?

####  Hardcoding Object References

- If we explicitly reference person.name inside the method, we are tightly coupling the function to that specific object. This makes it impossible to reuse the function with other objects or contexts.

``` javascript

const person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  greet() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${person.name}`; // Tightly coupled to `person`
  }
};

const anotherPerson = { name: 'Bob' };
console.log(person.greet()); // "Hello, my name is Alice"

// Reusing the method with another object is NOT possible:
console.log(person.greet.call(anotherPerson)); // Still prints "Alice" because of hardcoding

```

#### Changing Object References

- Objects are passed by reference. If we create copies of an existing object, the method will still refer to the original object.

``` javascript

const person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  greet() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${person.name}`; // Explicit reference
  }
};

const newPerson = person; // Copy the reference
console.log(newPerson.greet()); // Still refers to `person.name` even if `newPerson` is used

```


### 2. Reusability of Functions Across Different Contexts

``` javascript

function greet() {
  return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}`;
}
const person1 = { name: 'Alice', greet };
const person2 = { name: 'Bob', greet };

console.log(person1.greet()); // "Hello, my name is Alice"
console.log(person2.greet()); // "Hello, my name is Bob"

```

### 3. Dynamic Context in Event Handlers

- In event handlers, `this` often refers to the element that triggered the event, helping us handle dynamic interactions.

``` javascript

const button = document.querySelector('button');
button.addEventListener('click', function () {
  console.log(`Button clicked: ${this.textContent}`); // Refers to the clicked button
});

```

### 4. Constructor functions and classes

- `this` is essential in constructor functions and classes to refer to the object being created.
