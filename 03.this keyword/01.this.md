# this keyword

## Why do we need it

- `this` keyword provides a dynamic context to our functions. Depending on how we invoke a function, we can have different values of this inside same function which helps in reusability.
- Otherwise, that function will need to accept arguments to make it reusabe.


## Use cases

## 1. Accessing Object Properties Inside Methods

``` javascript

const person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  greet() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}`; // `this` refers to the `person` object
  }
};
console.log(person.greet()); // "Hello, my name is Alice"

```

- But, I can also do `person.name` so, what problem does `this` solves here ?

####  Hardcoding Object References

- If we explicitly reference person.name inside the method, we are tightly coupling the function to that specific object. This makes it impossible to reuse the function with other objects or contexts.

``` javascript

const person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  greet() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${person.name}`; // Tightly coupled to `person`
  }
};

const anotherPerson = { name: 'Bob' };
console.log(person.greet()); // "Hello, my name is Alice"

// Reusing the method with another object is NOT possible:
console.log(person.greet.call(anotherPerson)); // Still prints "Alice" because of hardcoding

```
