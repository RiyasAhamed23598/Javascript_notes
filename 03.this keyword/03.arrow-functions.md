# Dynamic scoping

- `this` is dynamically scoped. So, it does not matter where the function is written.
- The value of `this` depends upon how function is invoked and not where it is written.

## Problems with dynamic scoping


``` javascript

const obj = {
  name: "John",
  a() {
    console.log(this);

    function b() {
      console.log(this);
    }

    b();
  },
};

a();

```

## Arrow functions

- Arrow functions have lexical `this` behavior. That means the value of `this` depned upon where our arrow function is written and not how it is invoked.
