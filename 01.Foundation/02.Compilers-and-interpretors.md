# Compilers and Interpretors

- The JS engine contains a compiler and an interpretor among other things. Let's understand how they work.
- Their purpose is to convert a source code into a machine readable code and execute it. But follow different approaches to achieve so.

## Compiler

- Two step process. Compilation and then execution.
- During compilation, our source code is converted into machine code.
- During execution, this complied code is then executed.

## Benifits of compiler

- Compiled code is highly optimized and performant.

## Limitations

- Time cosuming process as we first have to wait for compilation for execution.

## Interpretors
