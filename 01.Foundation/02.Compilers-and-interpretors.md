# Compilers and Interpretors

- I want to run my source code on a machine. But that's not possible because source code is not understandable by machine.
- Compilers and interpretors help us with this.

## Compiler

- Two step process. Compilation and then execution.
- During compilation, complete source code is converted into machine code.
- During execution, this complied code is then executed.

## Benifits of compiler

- Compiled code is highly optimized and performant.
- Error detections occour during compilation which prevents runtime crashes.

## Limitations

- Time cosuming process as we first have to wait for compilation for execution.

## Interpretors

- Translation and execution happens together line by line.

## Benifits

- Immediate execution as we do not wait for compilation first.

## Limitations

- Slower execution and unpotimized code generation.
- Error detections during runtime.

## Examples

- `Babel` is a JavaScript compiler that takes modern JS code and return browser compatible code.
