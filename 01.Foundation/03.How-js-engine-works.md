- Both compilers and interpretors have their pros and cons.
- Why not use the best of both worlds.


## JIT Compilation

- JS Engine uses both an interpretor(ignition) and a compiler(TurboFan) to run code faster.
- Source code is first passed to an interpretor(ignition) which starts executing it right away.
- As the code is executing, The profiler identifies code that is frequently used.
- This frequently used code is then passed to the compiler for optimizations.
- The `compiler` and `profiler` are continiuosly optimizing the machine code generated by the interpretor.
