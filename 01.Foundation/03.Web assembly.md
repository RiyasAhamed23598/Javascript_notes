# Web assembly

- Browser downloads our JS source code and then the engine converts it into machine code with the help of interpretors and compilers.
- Why not serve machine code directly to the browser? That would save us the compilation time.
- But browsers have to adapt to accept machine code than JS code.
- WebAssembly (often abbreviated as Wasm) is a low-level, binary code format designed to run programs at near-native speed on web browsers.
