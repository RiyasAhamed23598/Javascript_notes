# ECMA Script

- ECMAScript is the standard, a rulebook that defines how a scripting language like JS should work, what all features it should have, syntax and behavior.
- Referring to this rulebook, JS is made and continuosly improved.
- Since browsers have their own JS engines and it is engine that runs our code, the rulebook will define that we should have a method called `structuredClone`.
- Now the implementation of that method is upto the browsers. But how it should work is defined by the rulebook.
