# ECMA Script

- ECMAScript is the standard on which JavaScript is built.
- It defines how JavaScript should work, including its features, syntax, and behavior.
- Since browsers have their own JS engines and it is engine that runs our code, the rulebook will define that we should have a methid called `structuredClone`.
- Now the implementation of that method is upto the browsers. But how it should work is defined by the rulebook.
