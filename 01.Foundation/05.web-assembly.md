# Web Assembly(WASM)

## Why

- Normally, websites use JavaScript to do everything interactive.
- But JavaScript can be slow when doing heavy tasks like gaming, video editing, image processing etc.

## How WA works

- WA is a standard binary executable format.
- We can write high performance code using languages like `Rust`, `Go`, `C++` which will be compiled to `wasm` files that browsers can execute.
- Taking fast, precompiled code in a special .wasm format that browsers can execute.
