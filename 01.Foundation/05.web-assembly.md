# Web Assembly(WASM)

## Why

- Normally, websites use JavaScript to add interactivity to our webpages.
- But JavaScript can be slow when doing heavy tasks like gaming, video editing, image processing etc.
- WebAssembly can handle the performance-heavy parts, while JavaScript manages the UI and other less demanding tasks.
- So, how do we do the heavy lifting tasks in the browser using JS?

## How WA works

- We write fast programs using languages like `Rust`, `Go`, `C++`.
- We copile the programs into a binary executable format called `.wasm`.
- Run wasm files in the browsers.
- Browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge have built-in WebAssembly support.
