# Web Assembly

## Why

- This whole process of interpretation and compilation is complex.
- We can directly provide machine code to the browsers by compiling our JS source code ahead of time.
- All the browsers have to agree on some common executable format to run JS.

## What is Web Assembly

- WA is a standard binary executable format.
- We can compile our source code to web assembly so that it runs extremely fast on the browser and we do not have to go through the entire process of compilation and interpretation.
