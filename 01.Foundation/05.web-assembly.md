# Web Assembly(WASM)

## What is Web Assembly

- WA is a standard binary executable format.
- We can write code is high level languages like `Rust`, `Go`, `C++` which will be compiled to WA.
- Browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge have built-in WebAssembly support.
- We can compile our source code to web assembly so that it runs extremely fast on the browser and we do not have to go through the entire process of compilation and interpretation.
