# Web Assembly(WASM)

## Why

- Normally, websites use JavaScript to do everything interactive, but JavaScript can be slow when doing heavy tasks like gaming, video editing, image processing etc.
- We can write high performance programs using languages like `C++`, `Rust`, or `Go`, and make them work in a browser just as fast as on your computer.
- We can write the fast programs using any language, compile them to wasm and browsers can then run these WASM files.

## How WA works

- WA is a standard binary executable format.
- We can write high performance code using languages like `Rust`, `Go`, `C++` which will be compiled to `wasm` files that browsers can execute.
- Taking fast, precompiled code in a special .wasm format that browsers can execute.
