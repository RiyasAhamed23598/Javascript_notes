# Web Assembly(WASM)

## Why

- Normally, websites use JavaScript to do everything interactive, but JavaScript can be slow when doing heavy tasks like gaming, video editing etc.

## What is Web Assembly

- WA is a standard binary executable format.
- We can write high performance code using languages like `Rust`, `Go`, `C++` which will be compiled to `wasm` files that browsers can execute.
- Taking fast, precompiled code in a special .wasm format that browsers can execute.
