# Why do we need JS Engines

- Computers only understand machine code.
- We need to convert our JS source code to machine code so that our CPU can execute the instructions.
- JS Engines help us convert JS code to machine code and execute it.
- Its main purpose is to read, interpret, and execute JavaScript.

## How JS runs on different platforms

- To execute JS we need JS engine.
- We can execute our JS in browsers, servers and IOT devices.
- This is possible because all these platforms have their JS engines.
- We have different JS engines like `Chakra`, `Spider Monkey`, `V8` etc.

## Ways to convert our source code to machine code and execute it.

## 1. Interpretor (Ignition)

- We give our source code to the interpretor.
- Interpretor starts executing it right away without waiting for it to be compiled first.
- It translates our code to machine code line by line or statement by statement during execution.
- Though, an interpretor can start execution early, it generates slow or unoptimized machine code.

## 2. Compilers (Turbo fan)

- Compilers scan our source code and coverts entire source code into machine code in one go.
- This generated machine code can then be executed by CPU.
- So there are two steps compilation and then execution.
- Execution is slower because we first need to compile entire codebase to machine code.
- The outputeed machine code is faster and highly optimized.

## Complier vs interpretor

- A compiler generally takes time to start but the code produced is faster and optimized.
- An interpretor can run rightaway but the output is slower and not optimized.
- JS combines best of both worlds and we get JIT compilation.

## Just in time (JIT) compilation

- Js engine uses best of both worlds (interpretor and compiler) so that our JS code runs faster.
- Engine starts executing our source code right away using an interpretor (ignition).
- Since the final output of interpretor is slow and unoptimized.
- Engines use a compiler(Turbo fan) to optimize the pieces of machine code generated by the interpretor.
- Since execution and compilation is happening together we call it JIT compliation.


## Is JS interpreted or compiled

- Depends on the engine implmentation.


## The process

- JavaScript source code
- Parser
- Parser converts it into AST.
- AST is then converted to machine code by an interpretor called ignition.
- The optimising compiler is called turbofan which produces optimized machine code.
- That's why we say JS is compiled as well as interpreted.
