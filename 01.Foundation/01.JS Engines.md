# JS Engine

## Why do we need it

- We want to give some instructions to a computer.
- But computers understand machine language only not our JavaScript code.
- So, we need a way to convert our JavaScript source code into machine readable code.
- JS engine understands the JavaSript code in and out and can convert it into machine code and then executes it.
