# JS Engine

## Why do we need it

- We want to give some instructions to a computer.
- But computers understand machine language only not our JavaScript code.
- So, we need a way to convert our JavaScript source code into machine readable code.
- JS engine takes our JS code, understands it in and out, converts it into machine code and then asks computer to executes it.

## Different types of engines

- V8 - Chrome
- Spider Monkey - Mozilla
- Chakra Microsoft - edge

## How does engine works

## Compilers and Interpretors

- The JS engine contains a compiler and an interpretor among other things. Let's understand how they work.
- Their purpose is to convert a source code into a machine readable code and execute it. But follow different approaches to achieve so.

## Compiler

- A compiler converts a high level programming code (JS source code) into machine code.
- We have two steps. Compilation and then execution.
- First our source code is compiled into machine code.
- Secondly, that machine code is executed.

## Benifits of compiler

- Compiled code is highly optimized and performant.

## Limitations

- Time cosuming process as we first have to wait for compilation for execution.

## Interpretors
