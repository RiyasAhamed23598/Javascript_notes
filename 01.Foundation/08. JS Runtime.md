# JavaScript Runtime

- JS engines run our code synchronously and one instruction at a time.
- What about the expensive operations like API calls, DOM manipulations, setTimeouts etc.
- So, we have something called `JS Runtime` which is like a container which has everything to run JS efficiently.
- `JS Runtime` includes JS Engine, WEB API's, callback queue and event loop.

## Web Apis

- JS can run in various platforms like browser, server, IOT devices.
- JS borrows addition fetaures from it's platform.
- `DOM,` `fetch`, `XMLHttp`, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `console`.
- They are made available to JS via global window object.
- We can use these web apis to perform some tasks in the background and return data once complete. In th meantime JS will not wait for these to complete.
- Even though JS is single threaded, we outsource all asynchronous tasks to the web API's.

## Node.js

- Node.js is a js runtime.
