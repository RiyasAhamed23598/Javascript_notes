# Call stack and memory heap

- To run our JS code, engine needs a call stack and a memory heap.

## Memory heap

- A memory heap is a region of a computer's memory used for dynamic memory allocation.
- A program can store, retrieve, write and remove data from the memory heap.
- Typically, the complex data structures like `Arrays`, `Objects`, `Functions` are stored in heap memory.


## Memory leaks

- Heap memory is finite. If we manage to fill all the space in the memory, our program will crash.
- It might happen that we have occupied some blocks of memory, but we no longer need them and for some reason, they are not garbage collected, so they stay in the memory forever.

## Common ways for memory leaks

- Too many global variables.
- Event listeners
- SetIntervals inside which we are referencing some data. That data will never be garbage collected unless we stopinterval.

## Call stack

- A call stack is a data structure that helps us keep track of function calls.
- Whenever we invoke a function, it gets pushed on top of the stack.
- When that function finishes execution, it is removed from the stack.
