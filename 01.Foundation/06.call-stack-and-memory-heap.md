# Call stack and memory heap

- Inside the JS engine, we also have a call stack and a memory heap.

## Memory heap

- A memory heap is a region of a computer's memory used for dynamic memory allocation.
- A program can store, retrieve, write and remove data from the memory heap.
- Typically, the complex data structures like `Arrays`, `Objects`, `Functions` are stored in heap memory.


## Call stack

- A call stack is a data structure that helps us keep track of function calls.
- Whenever we invoke a function, it gets pushed on top of the stack.
- When that function finishes execution, it is removed from the stack.
