# Call stack and memory heap

- Inside the JS engine, we also have a call stack and a memory heap.

## Memory heap

- A memory heap is a region of a computer's memory used for dynamic memory allocation.
- During program execution, we need to store, retrieve, write and remove data from the memory heap.
- Typically, the complex data structures like `Arrays`, `Objects`, `Functions` are stored in heap memory.
