# Runtime


## Single thread

- JavaScript is single threaded and synchronous language.
- Meanining, JS engine can execute only one task at a time. Multiple parallel tasks are not possible.
- Next task will start only if the previous task is finished.

## Limitations of single threaded

- Blocking operations. If we have a long running task, enire program will have to wait for it to complete as we can only perform one task at a time.
