## Single thread

- JavaScript is single threaded and synchronous language.
- Meanining, JS engine can execute only one task at a time. Multiple parallel tasks are not possible.
- Next tasks will start only if the previous task is finished.

## Limitations of single threaded

- Blocking operations. If we have a long running task, enire program will have to wait for it to complete as we can only perform one task at a time. And we cannot interact with out webpage till this task completes.
- Expensive tasks like network calls, DOM manipulations, timeouts cannot be performed without hanging the webpage.


## JS Runtime

- JS Engine alone is not enough because of single threaded nature.
- To build performant, non blocking applications we need JS Runtime.
- JS runtime consists of `JS Engine` (which has a stack, heap, compiler, interpretor, garbage collector), `WEB API's`, `task queues` and `event loop`.


## WEB API'S

- JS can run in various envvironments like browser, server, IOT devices atc.
- This environment provides a lot of features in the form of API's.
- These API'S are not native to JavaScript but provided by the environment in which JS is running.
- These applications run in the background, finish their task and lets JS know that I am done with my task.
- Browser exposes these API's to JS using window object.
- `fetch` API, `DOM` API, `local, session storage` API, `setTimeout`, `setInterval` etc.
