## Single thread

- JavaScript is single threaded and synchronous language.
- Meanining, JS engine can execute only one task at a time. Multiple parallel tasks are not possible.
- Next tasks will start only if the previous task is finished.

## Limitations of single threaded

- Blocking operations. If we have a long running task, enire program will have to wait for it to complete as we can only perform one task at a time. And we cannot interact with out webpage till this task completes.


## JS Runtime

- JS Engine alone is not enough because of single threaded nature.
- To build performant, no blocking applications we need JS Runtime.
- JS runtime consists of `JS Engine` (which has a stack, heap, compiler, interpretor, garbage collector), `WEB API's`, `task queues` and `event loop`.
