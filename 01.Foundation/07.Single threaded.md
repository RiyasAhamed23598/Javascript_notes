# Single threaded

- JS is a single threaded, synchronous programming language.
- Let's say we have a list of instructions for JS Engine to execute.
- JS Engine has only one call stack and can execute only one instruction at a time.
- Synchronous means it will finish one instruction then jump on to next one.

## Problems with synchronous nature

- If we have a long running task which takes time to complete, we will not be able to interact with our page in the meantime.
- It will freeze our webpage.
- Because it can execute only one instruction at a time and it is already executing one.
- Example is how `alert` works.
