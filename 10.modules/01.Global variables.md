# Why is it bad to have global variables

#### Instead of managing scope chains, lexical environment, variable environment, why not put everything in global space?

- **Memory Consumption** We have limited, finite memory. Global variables persist in the memory for lifetime of the application.
- **Name Colissions** Multiple scripts or parts of a program may define global variables with the same name, leading to unintentional overwriting.
- **Debugging** Since, any part of the program can access and modify global data, application becomes hard to debug.

## IIFE(Imeediately Invoked Function Expression)

- Today we have modern techniques like ES6 modules to manage scopes. But before that we used an IIFE.
