# Inheritence

- Inheritence allows a class or object to derive properties and methods from another class or object.
- If there is some behavior that we want to share across multiple classes, we define it only once in a base class and make it available to all subclasses.

## Code reusability

- If we have some methods or properties that we want to share across multiple classes, like all arrays should have methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce` etc. we can define them in the parent class.

## Memory

- Instead of adding the common methods to all the instances, we can add the methods once in a base class and all subclasses will have access to it.
