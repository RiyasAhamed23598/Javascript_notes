# Inheritence

- Inheritence allows a class or object to derive properties and methods from another class or object.
- If there is some behavior that we want to share across multiple classes, we define it only once in a base class and make it available to all subclasses.

## Code reusability

- If we have some methods or properties that we want to share across multiple classes, like all arrays should have methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce` etc. we can define them in the parent class.

## Memory

- Instead of adding the common methods to all the instances, we can add the methods once in a base class and all subclasses will have access to it.
- Imagine if all arrays we create have their own utility methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce` etc.
- That will be very inefficient for memory.

## Code duplication

- Instead of defining the utilities for every class, we define them in one central place.
- So, we have a single source of truth and tomorrow if we want to refactor a piece of code, we have to do it at one place only.
