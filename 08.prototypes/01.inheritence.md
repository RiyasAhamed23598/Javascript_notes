# Inheritence

- I want to add some common properties and utility methods to all the object instances  that I create.
- Like all arrays should have access to utility methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce` etc.
- Well, we could write that behavior in all the instances. But that could lead to code duplication and inefficient memory.
- Another way could be to use global object for shared state. But that state would be available to all and not just few instances. Like `map`, `filter`, `reduce` will be avilable to all types instead of just arrays.

## Code duplication

- Without inheritence, we will have to define utilities in every instance that we create.
- When we need to refactor some code, we will have to do it in multiple places. There is no single source of truth.
- So, we have a single source of truth and tomorrow if we want to refactor a piece of code, we have to do it at one place only.


## Memory

- Instead of adding the common methods to all the instances, we can add the methods once in a base class and all subclasses will have access to it.
- Imagine if all arrays we create have their own utility methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce` etc.
- That will be very inefficient for memory.
