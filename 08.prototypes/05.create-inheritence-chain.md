# Create inheritence chains

## Object.create()

- Creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object.
- It does two things, creates a new object and sets it's proto to an existing object.
- We can define all common methods in one object and then use Object.create to create new objects.
- `Object.create(proto, propertiesObject)`

``` javascript
const person = {
  isHuman: false,
  printIntroduction: function () {
    console.log(`My name is ${this.name}. Am I human? ${this.isHuman}`);
  },
};

const me = Object.create(person);

me.name = "Matthew"; // "name" is a property set on "me", but not on "person"
me.isHuman = true; // Inherited properties can be overwritten

me.printIntroduction();
// Expected output: "My name is Matthew. Am I human? true"

```
