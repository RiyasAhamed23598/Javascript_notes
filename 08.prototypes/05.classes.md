# Classes

- JavaScript follows object and prototypes based inheritence.
- Classes are just a syntactic sugar which simplifies object oriented programming but behind the scenes prototypes are bieng used.

``` javascript
class Human {
  type = "human";
  name = "Human";

  talk() {
    return "talking";
  }
  eat() {}
}

const me = new Human();
```

Equivalent prototype code

``` javascript
function Human() {
  this.name = "human";
  this.type = "human";
}

Human.prototype.talk = function () {
  return 'talking';
};

Human.prototype.eat = function () {
  return 'eating';
};
```

Inheritence with classes

``` javascript
class Human {
  humanProperty1 = "humanProperty1";
  humanProperty2 = "humanProperty2";

  humanMethod1() {
    return "HumanMethod1";
  }
  humanMethod2() {
    return "HumanMethod1";
  }
}

class SuperHuman extends Human {
  superHumanProperty1 = "superHumanProperty1";
  superHumanProperty2 = "superHumanProperty2";

  superHumanMethod1() {
    return "SuperHumanMethod1";
  }
  superHumanMethod2() {
    return "SuperHumanMethod1";
  }
}

```

- When we create instance of `SuperHuman`, it will be an object that contains properties `superHumanProperty1`, `superHumanProperty2`, `humanProperty1` and `humanProperty2`.
- Also, it will have the special property `__ proto __` which will refer to `SuperHuman.prototype` which contains methods like `superHumanMethod1` and `superHumanMethod2`.
- Now `SuperHuman.prototype` is also an object so it's `__ proto __` will refer to `Human.prototype` which has methods like `humanMethod1` and `humanMethod2`.
- `Human.prototype` is also an object and it's `__ proto __` will refer to `Object.prototype`.
- `Object.prototype` is also an object whose `__ proto __` refers to `null`.

## super keyword

- The `super` keyword refers to the parent class and can be used to.
- Accessing the Parent Class Constructor. `super(arguments)`
- Accessing Methods and Properties of the Parent Class. `super.parentMethod()`

``` javascript
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    constructor(name, breed) {
        super(name); // Calls the parent class constructor
        this.breed = breed;
    }

    getDetails() {
        return `${this.name} is a ${this.breed}`;
    }
}

const dog = new Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever");
console.log(dog.getDetails()); // Buddy is a Golden Retriever

```


``` javascript
class Vehicle {
    start() {
        console.log("Vehicle is starting...");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    start() {
        super.start(); // Calls the parent class method
        console.log("Car is now running!");
    }
}

const car = new Car();
car.start();
// Output:
// Vehicle is starting...
// Car is now running!

```
