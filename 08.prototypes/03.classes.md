# Classes

- JavaScript follows object and prototypes based inheritence.
- Classes are just a syntactic sugar which simplifies inheritence but behind the scenes prototypes are bieng used.

``` javascript
class Human {
  type = "human";
  name = "Human";

  talk() {
    return "talking";
  }
  eat() {}
}

const me = new Human();
```

Equivalent prototype code

``` javascript
function Human() {
  this.name = "human";
  this.type = "human";
}

Human.prototype.talk = function () {
  return 'talking';
};

Human.prototype.eat = function () {
  return 'eating';
};
```

Inheritence with classes

``` javascript
class Human {
  humanProperty1 = "humanProperty1";
  humanProperty2 = "humanProperty2";

  humanMethod1() {
    return "HumanMethod1";
  }
  humanMethod2() {
    return "HumanMethod1";
  }
}

class SuperHuman extends Human {
  superHumanProperty1 = "superHumanProperty1";
  superHumanProperty2 = "superHumanProperty2";

  superHumanMethod1() {
    return "SuperHumanMethod1";
  }
  superHumanMethod2() {
    return "SuperHumanMethod1";
  }
}

```

- When we create instance of `SuperHuman`, it will be an object that contains properties `superHumanProperty1`, `superHumanProperty2`, `humanProperty1` and `humanProperty2`.
- Also, it will have the special property `__ proto __` which will refer to `SuperHuman.prototype` which contains methods like `superHumanMethod1` and `superHumanMethod2`.
- Now `SuperHuman.prototype` is also an object so it's `__ proto __` will refer to `Human.prototype` which has methods like `humanMethod1` and `humanMethod2`.
- `Human.prototype` is also an object and it's `__ proto __` will refer to `Object.prototype`.
- `Object.prototype` is also an object whose `__ proto __` refers to `null`.
