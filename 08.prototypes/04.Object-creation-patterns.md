# Object creation patterns

- We want to create objects that share some behavior.
- Of course we can create objects using `obj = {}` but the ask here is objects share some common behavior.

## Factory functions

- A function that creates an object and returns them.
- Does not require `new` keyword or `this` so it's simpler and flexible.
- Each instance will have a seperate copy of methods which is bad for the memory because function is same but we are adding it to memory multiple times.

``` javascript
function createCar(name, model) {
  const car = {
    name: name,
    model: model,
    getCarDetails() {
      return `${name} ${model}`;
    },
  };
  return car;
}
```

## Constructor functions

- By convention, name starts with a capital letter.
- A new object is implicitly created and returned. We manually do not create or return object like in factory functions.
- So, a new object is automatically created and `this` keyword refers to that object. We can add properties to the instance using `this` keyword.
- Since, methods are added to the prototype and not individual instances, it saves memory.
- Common built in constructor functions includes `Object`, `Array`, `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Date`, `Function`, `Promise`, `Map`, `Set`, `Error` etc.

## How new keyword works

- A new object is automatically created.
- `this` refers to the newly created object.
- This object is linked to the prototype of constructor function.
- New object is returned.

``` javascript
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

// Attach method to the prototype
Person.prototype.greet = function () {
  return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
};

const person1 = new Person('Alice', 30);
const person2 = new Person('Bob', 25);

console.log(person1.greet()); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
console.log(person2.greet()); // Output: Hello, my name is Bob and I am 25 years old.

```
