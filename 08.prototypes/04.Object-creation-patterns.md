# Object creation patterns

- We want to create objects that share some behavior.
- Of course we can create objects using `obj = {}` but the ask here is objects share some common behavior.

## Factory functions

- A function that creates an object and returns them.
- Does not require `new` keyword or `this` so it's simpler and flexible.

``` javascript
function createCar(name, model) {
  const car = {
    name: name,
    model: model,
    getCarDetails() {
      return `${name} ${model}`;
    },
  };
  return car;
}
```
