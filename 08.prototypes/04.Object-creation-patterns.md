# Object creation patterns

- We want to create objects that share some behavior.
- Of course we can create objects using `obj = {}` but the ask here is objects share some common behavior.

## Factory functions

- A function that creates an object and returns them.
- Does not require `new` keyword or `this` so it's simpler and flexible.
- Each instance will have a seperate copy of methods which is bad for the memory because function is same but we are adding it to memory multiple times.

``` javascript
function createCar(name, model) {
  const car = {
    name: name,
    model: model,
    getCarDetails() {
      return `${name} ${model}`;
    },
  };
  return car;
}
```

## Constructor functions

- By convention, name starts with a capital letter.
- A new object is implicitly created and returned. We manually do not create or return object like in factory functions.
- So, a new object is automatically created and `this` keyword refers to that object. We can add properties to the instance using `this` keyword.

## How new keyword works

- A new object is automatically created.
- `this` refers to the newly created object.
- This object is linked to the prototype of constructor function.
- New object is returned.
