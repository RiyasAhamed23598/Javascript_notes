# Prototype chain

- Whenever we search for a property in an object, it first tries to find in the object itself. If not found, it goes to it's proto then it's proto and so on till it reaches `null`.
- If it reaches `null` than we cannot find the value and `undefined` is returned.

## How to create prototype chain

## Object.create()

- Creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object.
- It does two things, creates a new object and sets it's proto to an existing object.
- We can define all common methods in one object and then use Object.create to create new objects.
- `Object.create(proto, propertiesObject)`

``` javascript
const person = {
  isHuman: false,
  printIntroduction: function () {
    console.log(`My name is ${this.name}. Am I human? ${this.isHuman}`);
  },
};

const me = Object.create(person);

me.name = "Matthew"; // "name" is a property set on "me", but not on "person"
me.isHuman = true; // Inherited properties can be overwritten

me.printIntroduction();
// Expected output: "My name is Matthew. Am I human? true"

```

``` javascript
const human = { kind: "human" };

const me = Object.create(human);
me.age = 27;

const you = Object.create(me);

console.log(you.age);
console.log(you.kind);

```

- First we create an object `human`. Since it is a type, it will have `__ proto __` which refers to `Object.prototype`.
- Then we create `me` object which has a property `age` and it's `__ proto __` is refrerring to the `human` object.
- Then we create `you` object whose `__ proto __` refers to the `me` object.
- So, when we search for `age` in `you`, it is first searched in `you` object. Since, It's not there it is then searched in it's proto which refers to the `me` object. `Me` object has `age` property, so our search finishes.
- When we search for `kind`, it is first searched in `you` object. Then it's `proto` which is the `me` object. Since we still don't find it we keep going up the chain and look in `human` object.

## Object.assign()

- Cpies all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object.
- It returns the modified target object.
- `Object.assign(target, source1, source2, /* â€¦, */ sourceN)`
- Later sources' properties overwrite earlier ones.

``` javascript
const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const source = { b: 4, c: 5 };

const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);

console.log(target);
// Expected output: Object { a: 1, b: 4, c: 5 }

console.log(returnedTarget === target);
// Expected output: true
```

## Object.setPrototypeOf()

``` javascript
const person = {
  isHuman: false,
  printIntroduction: function () {
    console.log(`My name is ${this.name}. Am I human? ${this.isHuman}`);
  },
};

const me = {};

Object.setPrototypeOf(me, person);
console.log(me.isHuman); // false

```
