# Data Types in JavaScript

- 7 types
- Number, boolean, string, object, null, undefined and symbol.
- We have `typeof` operator that gives us type of a value.
- typeof null gives object.
- Arrays and functions are objects.

## Undefined vs Null

- `undefined` means absense of a definition. You declared something but never initialized it. So, it gets a special placeholder or a default value.
- `undefined` simply means there is a variable present but has no value.
- `Null` is the absence of a value. Like a person does not have a middle name.
