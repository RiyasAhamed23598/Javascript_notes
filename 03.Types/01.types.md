# Data Types in JavaScript

- 7 types
- Number, boolean, string, object, null, undefined and symbol.
- We have `typeof` operator that gives us type of a value.
- typeof null gives object.

## Undefined vs Null

- `undefined` means absense of a definition. You declared something but never initialized it. So, it gets a special placeholder or a default value.
