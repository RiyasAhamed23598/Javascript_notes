# Data Types in JavaScript

- 7 types
- Number, boolean, string, object, null, undefined and symbol.
- We have `typeof` operator that gives us type of a value.
- typeof null gives object.
- Arrays and functions are objects.

## Undefined vs Null

- `undefined` means absense of a definition. You declared something but never initialized it. So, it gets a special placeholder or a default value.
- `undefined` simply means there is a variable present but has no value.
- `Null` is the absence of a value. Like a person does not have a middle name. 

## Primitives vs Non Primitives

- Primitives are simple and basic types that cannot be broken down further into smaller types.
- When you create a primitive, it stores the actual value.
- Reference types are more complex and can store collections of data. like objects, arrays, functions.
- When you create a reference type, it stores a reference (or "pointer") to the actual data in memory.

## How to check array type

- Since, `typeof` [] gives us a n object. How can we check if variable is an array or not.
- `Array.isArray(variable)` returns true or false.
