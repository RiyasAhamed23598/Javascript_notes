# Programming languages classification

- There are a lot of programming languages. A way to classify them would be strong vs weak or static vs dynamically typed.
- JS is weak and dynamically typed.

## Static vs dynamically typed languages

- The key difference is when and how the type of a variable is determined.


## 1. When Type Checking Occurs

- In staticaly typed languages, we explicitly define types of our variables while declaring them.
- So, type checking happens during compilation.
- Our code is self documented, more readable, type safe and less error prone.
- We can catch type related errors during compilation phase.
