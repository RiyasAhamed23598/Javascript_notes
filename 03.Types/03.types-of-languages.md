# Programming languages classification

- There are a lot of programming languages. A way to classify them would be strong vs weak or static vs dynamically typed.
- JS is weak and dynamically typed.

# Static vs dynamically typed languages

- The key difference is when and how the type of a variable is determined.
- In a statically typed language, the type of a variable is known and checked at compile time (i.e., before the program runs).
- You must declare the types of your variables explicitly, it cannot be changed later.
- If you try to assign a different type to a variable (e.g., a string to an integer variable), the compiler will throw an error before the program can even run.
- In a dynamically typed language, the type of a variable is determined at runtime (i.e., while the program is running).
- You do not need to specify types explicitly. The interpreter figures out the type based on the value assigned to the variable during execution.
- The type-checking happens at runtime, so errors related to types are not caught until the program runs and encounters an issue.
