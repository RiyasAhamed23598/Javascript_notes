# Composition

- I have some data and I want that multiple functions act on that data one by one like a data pipeline.
- Each step produces some output that is passed as input to th next step(function).
- So, it's like a chain of steps wherein every step we do modify the data and pass the modified data to the next step.

``` javascript
const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}`;
const shout = (sentence) => sentence.toUpperCase();

const greetLoudly = (name) => shout(greet(name));

console.log(greetLoudly("Alice")); // HELLO, ALICE

```

``` javascript
const filterActiveUsers = (users) => users.filter((user) => user.active);
const extractNames = (users) => users.map((user) => user.name);
const sortNames = (names) => names.sort();

const processUsers = compose(sortNames, extractNames, filterActiveUsers);

const users = [
  { name: "Alice", active: true },
  { name: "Bob", active: false },
  { name: "Charlie", active: true },
];

console.log(processUsers(users)); // ["Alice", "Charlie"]

```

But, I can achieve the same thing by making sequential function calls. So, why composition?

### 1. Improved Readability

``` javascript
const output = operation5(operation4(operation3(operation2(operation1(input)))));

const processPipeline = compose(operation5, operation4, operation3, operation2, operation1);
const output = processPipeline(input);

```
