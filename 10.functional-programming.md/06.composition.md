# Composition

- I have some data and I want that multiple functions act on that data one by one like a data pipeline.
- Each step produces some output that is passed as input to th next step(function).
- So, it's like a chain of steps wherein every step we do modify the data and pass the modified data to the next step.

``` javascript
const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}`;
const shout = (sentence) => sentence.toUpperCase();

const greetLoudly = (name) => shout(greet(name));

console.log(greetLoudly("Alice")); // HELLO, ALICE

```
