# Immutability

- Data cannot be modified modified after it is created.
- Instead of changing (mutating) data, new copies of the data are created when changes are necessary.

## Why is Immutability Important?

## Predictability

- If multiple methods are mutating data, it gets hard to debug and maintain the application.
- Since we cannot modify data, we ensure our code is predictable.
