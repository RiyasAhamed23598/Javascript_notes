# Immutability

- Data structures are not modified after they are created.
- Instead of changing (mutating) data, new copies of the data are created when changes are necessary.

## Why is Immutability Important?

## Predictability

- Since data doesn't change, the behavior of functions working with that data is consistent and easier to understand.
