# Immutability

- Data cannot be modified modified after it is created.
- Instead of changing (mutating) data, new copies of the data are created when changes are necessary.

## Why is Immutability Important?

## Predictability

- Since data doesn't change, the behavior of functions working with that data is consistent and easier to understand.
- Otherwise, if multiple behaviors were changing data, it would be hard to maintain and debug.

## No Side Effects

- Immutability prevents unintended changes to data, reducing bugs and making the code more reliable.
