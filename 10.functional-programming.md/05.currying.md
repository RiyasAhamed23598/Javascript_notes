# Currying

- A function with multiple arguments is transformed into a series of functions, each taking one argument at a time.

``` javascript
 function add(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return a + b;
  };
}
const add5 = add(5);
console.log(add5(3)); // 8

```

## Why currying

### Reusable functions

- Currying allows you to create reusable functions by breaking down a function into smaller, more specialized functions.
- For instance, a function that adds two numbers can be curried into a reusable addition function that can generate specific adders like `add5` or `add10`.



# Partial applications

- Partially apply arguments to a function, fixing some arguments while leaving others dynamic.
