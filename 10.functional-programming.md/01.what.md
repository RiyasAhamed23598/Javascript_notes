# Functional programming

- There is a seperation between data and behaviors(functions).
- There is data and functions that interact with this data. But we are not going to combine them in a single unit like in object oriented world.

## Core principles

- Pure Functions
- Immutability
- Function Composition
- Declarative Programming
- Referential Transparency
- Lazy Evaluation
- No Side Effects
