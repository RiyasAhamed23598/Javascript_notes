# Modules

## Code Organization

- Modules allow us to split our code into multiple smaller files based on single responsibility pronciple.
- This improves, readability, debugging and maintainability.

## Scoping

- Modules create their own scope called Module. All the data added by a script tag is now scoped under module scope.
- It prevents memory leaks and name conflicts.

## Data privacy

- Modules provide a way to expose only the necessary details to the outside world while keeping the internal implementation hidden.

## Dependencies

- With modules managing dependencies is a lot easier.
