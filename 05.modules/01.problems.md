# Problems without modules


``` html
  <script src="./script1.js" defer></script>
  <script src="./script2.js" defer></script>
  <script src="./script3.js" defer></script>
  <script src="./script4.js" defer></script>
  <script src="./script5.js" defer></script>
```

## Global namespace pollution

- All scripts are adding data (variables and methods) to the global scope.
- So, we might end up overriding the existing data in the global scope.
- Also, this can lead to memory leaks.
- This makes our code unpredeictable and difficult to maintain.

## Data privacy

- Since all the data is present in the global scope, any part of the application can access this data.
- This can be very hard to debug if multiple parts of application are mutating the same data. We will never know what part of the application changed the data.

## Self-Executing Initialization Code

- Code that needs to run immediately but should not leave any residue in the global scope.
- What we typically do is create a function and then invoke it immediately. But that function gets added to the global scope.

## Managing dependencies
