# Problems without modules

## Global namespace pollution

- All application data (variables and methods) resides in the global scope.
- All the scripts are adding data (variables and methods) to the same global scope.
- So, we might end up overriding the existing data in the global scope.
- This makes our code very difficult to maintain and unpredeictable.

## Data privacy

- Since all the data is present in the global scope, any part of the application can access this data.
- This can be very hard to debug if multiple parts of application are mutating the same data. We will never know what part of the application changed the data.

## Self-Executing Initialization Code

- Code that needs to run immediately but should not leave any residue in the global scope.
- What we typically do is create a function and then invoke it immediately. But that function gets added to the global scope.
