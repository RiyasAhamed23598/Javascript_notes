# IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

- An IIFE is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.

``` javascript
(() => {
  // some initiation code
  let firstVariable;
  let secondVariable;
})();

// firstVariable and secondVariable will be discarded after the function is executed.

```

## Global namespace pollution

- Data is not added to the global scope which prevents memory leaks.
- All the data created inside the IIFE is scoped and not accessible by outer world.


## Initiation code

- We have some initiation code that we don't need to use again.
- Using IIFE is better here as it does not add any extra function or variable to the global scope.
