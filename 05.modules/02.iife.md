# IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

- An IIFE is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.

``` javascript
(() => {
  // some initiation code
  let firstVariable;
  let secondVariable;
})();

// firstVariable and secondVariable will be discarded after the function is executed.

```
