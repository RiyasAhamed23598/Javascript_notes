# ECMA Script

- We have a lot of JS engines like chakra, spider monkey, V8 etc.
- Anybody can build their own JS engine.
- That can lead to caos as different engines might support different features. Like v8 can say hey I have come up with a new feature but chakra and spider monkey might not support it.
