# How JS works

- JS is a single threaded programming language. It means it has only one call stack and it can do only one thing at a time.
- Call stack is a data structure that tracks where in the program we are currently.

## Blocking operations

- Some operations tend to take time like image processing, network calls, some very complex algorithm.
- Since JS can do only one thing at a time, while it is performing this complex task, we are blocked.
- We just have to wait till these operations complete.

## Why is that a problem

- Because we are running our code in the browser.
- While JS waits for blocking operation to complete, we cannot interact with our webpage because thread is busy.
- This gives bad user experience.

## Concurrency and event loop

- It is correct JS is single threaded and can do only one thing at a time.
- But apart from V8 engine, browsers also have web apis.
- Web api's are the external API's exposed by the browser to make our experience better and use some native browser functionalities like setTimeout, setInterval, DOM manipulations, console.log().
- When JS engine encounters these web apis, they are not added to the stack but web API's handle them seperately.
- Whenever these web API's complete a task they push the callback code into the task queue.
- Event loop has one simple task. To look at call stack and task queue and whenever call stack is empty push the first item from queue to the stack.
