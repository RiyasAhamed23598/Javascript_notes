# JavaScript Runtime

- To build a high perfromance systems, we need something more than just the JS engines. Because JS engines run our code synchronously and one instruction at a time.
- JS runtime consists of
- JS Engine
- WEB Api
- Task and microtask queue
- Event loop

## Web Apis

- Web APIs are some features provided by the browser (or another environment like Node.js) that allow JavaScript code to interact with various system-level resources and services.
- `DOM,` `fetch`, `XMLHttp`, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `console`.
- They are made available to JS via global window object.
