# Garbage collection

- It is a mechanism where JS can free up the memory by automatically removing unused information.
- We do not have to manually allocate and deallocate memory.
- JS uses Mark and sweep algorithm for garbage collection.

## Mark and sweep

- We have variables referencing to a memory location.
- If any node in the memory is not referenced by any pointer, it's garbage collected.
