# Why do we need JS engines

- We can execute our JS in browsers, servers and IOT devices.
- This is possible because all these platforms have their JS engines.
- Whose purpose is to convert our JS code into optimized machine code.
- JS is dynamically typed language. We do not have to define types of our variables while declaring them.
- But it is not good for compilers to generate fast machine code because we have so little information about the types.

## Just in time (JIT) compilation

- Generally code execution is done in two steps. First is the compilation process which generates an executable machine code and then run that executable. This is called Ahead of time (AOT) compilation.
- When you run JavaScript, the engine doesn't compile everything in advance.
- Compilation and execution happens together.
- We generally have two types of compilers baseline and optimising. One converts our JS code to machine code on the fly and the other optimises this machine code further.

## The process

- JavaScript source code
- Parser
- Parser converts it into AST.
- AST is then converted to machine code by an interpretor called ignition.
- The optimising compiler is called turbofan which produces optimized machine code.
- That's why we say JS is compiled as well as interpreted.

## Optimising compiler

- It works well if our objects do not change types.
- So, we should avoid changing types of our objects.
