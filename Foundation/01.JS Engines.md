# Why do we need JS engines

- We can execute our JS in browsers, servers and IOT devices.
- This is possible because all these platforms have their JS engines.
- Whose purpose is to convert our JS code into optimized machine code.
- JS is dynamically typed language. We do not have to define types of our variables while declaring them.
- But it is not good for compilers to generate fast machine code because we have so little information about the types.

## Just in time (JIT) compilation

- Generally code execution is done in two steps. First is the compilation process which generates an executable machine code and then run that executable. This is called Ahead of time (AOT) compilation.
- When you run JavaScript, the engine doesn't compile everything in advance.
- Compilation and execution happens together.
- We generally have two types of compilers where one is optimizer. Functions that are bieng used often are recompiled into faster and better machine code.
