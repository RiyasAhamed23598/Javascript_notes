# Why do we need JS engines

- We can execute our JS in browsers, servers and IOT devices.
- This is possible because all these platforms have their JS engines.
- Computers understand only machine language. They cannot make sense of our JavaScript code.
- So, we must convert our JS code to machine readable code.
- JS engine understands our JS and tell our computer to perform some instructions.
- Whose purpose is to convert our JS code into optimized machine code and execute it.
- JS is dynamically typed language. We do not have to define types of our variables while declaring them.
- But it is not good for compilers to generate fast machine code because we have so little information about the types.

## Interpretor

-  An interpreter translates source code into machine code line-by-line or statement-by-statement during runtime.
-  The source code is executed directly by the interpreter, meaning no separate executable is produced.
-  Interpreted programs tend to run slower since the code is being translated and executed in real-time, line by line.
-  We can start executing our program immediately without waiting for it to be compiled first.

## Compilers

- A compiler translates the entire source code of a program into machine code in one go.
- After the source code is compiled, the generated machine code is executed by the computer. This means the compiled program can run independently of the compiler.
- Compiled programs generally run faster since the entire code is already translated into machine language before execution.
- Compiler generated machine code is optimized and better performant than interpreted.

## Complier vs interpretor

- A compiler generally takes time to start but the code produced is faster and optimized.
- An interpretor can run rightaway but the output is slower and not optimized.
- JS combines best of both worlds and we get JIT compilation.

## Just in time (JIT) compilation

- Generally code execution is done in two steps. First is the compilation process which generates an executable machine code and then run that executable. This is called Ahead of time (AOT) compilation.
- When you run JavaScript, the engine doesn't compile everything in advance.
- Compilation and execution happens together.
- We generally have an interpretor(Ignition) and a compiler(Turbo fan).


## The process

- JavaScript source code
- Parser
- Parser converts it into AST.
- AST is then converted to machine code by an interpretor called ignition.
- The optimising compiler is called turbofan which produces optimized machine code.
- That's why we say JS is compiled as well as interpreted.

## Optimising compiler

- It works well if our objects do not change types.
- So, we should avoid changing types of our objects.
