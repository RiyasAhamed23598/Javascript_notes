# Memory leaks

- Our heap is limited in size. It has a finite capacity.
- If we end up storing more data than heap's capacity we cause a memory leak.

## What can cause a memory leak

- Global variables
- Event listeners
- Using setIntervals and accessing some objects inside the callback. These objects will never be garbage collected.
