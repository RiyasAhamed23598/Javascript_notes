# Call stack and Memory heap

- JS engines have a call stack and a memory heap.
- The task of the engine is to execute our code.
- To do so, we need to read and write to the memory. For that engines have heap. Heaps help us store and retrieve data in our code.
- We also need to track where we currently are in a program. Stack helps us with that.
