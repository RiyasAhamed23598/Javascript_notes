# JS Engine

## Why do we need it

- We want to give some instructions to a computer.
- But computers understand machine language only not our JavaScript code.
- So, we need a way to convert our JavaScript source code into machine readable code and execute it.
- JS engine takes our JS code, understands it in and out, converts it into machine code and then asks computer to executes it.

## Different types of engines

- V8 - Chrome
- Spider Monkey - Mozilla
- Chakra Microsoft - edge

## Some followup questions

- Why machines don't understand JS code?
- Why don't we code in machine language?
