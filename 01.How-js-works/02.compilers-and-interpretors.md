# Compilers and Interpretors

- To execute high level programs on a machine, we use compilers and interpretors.

## Compiler

- Two step process. Compilation and then execution.
- During compilation, complete source code is converted into machine code.
- During execution, this complied code is then executed.

## Benifits of compiler

- Compiled code is highly optimized and performant.
- Error detections occour during compilation which prevents runtime crashes.

## Limitations

- Time cosuming process as we first have to wait for compilation for execution.

## Interpretors

- Translation and execution happens together line by line.

## Benifits

- Immediate execution as we do not wait for compilation first.

## Limitations

- Slower execution and unpotimized code generation.
- Error detections during runtime.

## Examples

- `Babel` is a JavaScript compiler that takes modern JS code and return browser compatible code.
