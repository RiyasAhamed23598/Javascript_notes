# Try catch

- Inside the `try` block, We write the code that can potentialy cause an error.
- Inside the `try` block, if we encounter any error, the further code stops executing and control shifts to the `catch` block.
- `catch` block takes an argument which is an `Error` instance.
- We also have a `finally` block that runs after `try` or `catch` has finished executing. We can run code that should execute regardless error or no error.

``` javascript
function fail() {
  try {
    // Error prone code
    throw new Error("Something went wrong");
    console.log("Try block works");
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
    console.log(error);
  } finally {
    // Run code regardless of error or no error.
  }
}

fail();
```

It does not handle asynchronous errors

``` javascript
function fail() {
  try {
    setTimeout(() => {
      throw new Error("Async error");
    });
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
    console.log(error);
  } finally {
    // Run code regardless of error or no error.
  }
}

fail();
```
