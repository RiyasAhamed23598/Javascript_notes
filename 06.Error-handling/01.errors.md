# Why Error Handling

- There is no such thing as a perfect program.
- We must have a mechanism to handle the errors gracefully so that it does not impacts the user experience.
- Also, Runtime errors cause execution of script to stop.
- No further code executes. Event handlers also stop working.
- So, we can no longer interact with our webpage. Hence we need to do error handling.

## throw

- Throw is used to generate execptions or errors.
- We can throw anything like a boolean number, string, Error objects etc.
- Execution of code stops after `throw` and the control is passed to the `catch` block.
- If there is no `catch` block, program terminates.

``` javascript

function sum(...values) {
  if (!values.every(isNumeric)) {
    throw new TypeError("Can only add numbers");
  }
  return values.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); // 6
try {
  sum("1", "2");
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e); // TypeError: Can only add numbers
}
```

## Error

- `Error` is a constructor function that helps us create error objects.
- Every object has properties like `name`, `message` ans `stack`.
- Error is just an object and it does not cause our scripts to stop. It's only when we use it with `throw` keyword.
- Using stack property, we can debug the error. It prints the entire call stack for us to help us debug better.

``` javascript
  const error = new Error("Something went wrong");
```
