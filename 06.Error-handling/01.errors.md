# Why Error Handling

- Runtime errors cause execution of script to stop.
- No further code executes. Event handlers also stop working.
- So, we can no longer interact with our webpage. Hence we need to do error handling.

## Error

- `Error` is a constructor function that helps us create error objects.
- Every object has properties like `name`, `message` ans `stack`.
- Error is just an object and it does not cause our scripts to stop. It's only when we use it with `throw` keyword.

``` javascript
  const error = new Error("Something went wrong");
```
