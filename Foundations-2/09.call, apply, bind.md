# Call, apply and bind


## Call and apply

- To invoke a function with a given value of `this`.
- First argumnet is always bound with `this`.
- Apply accepts array of parameters whereas with call we can specify a list.
- Even though we pass an array, it still get recieived individually and not  awhole array.

## Bind

- Bind doesn't invoke the function immediately. But it sets the context and parameters for a function that needs to be executed in th near future.
