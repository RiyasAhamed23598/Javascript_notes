# Hoisting

- JS engine allocates memory to our variables and functions during creation phase before code executions starts.
- It scans through our code and allocates memory to functions and variables.
- Functions are fully hoisted.
- Variables with `var` keyword are partially hoisted as they are initialized to `undefined`.
