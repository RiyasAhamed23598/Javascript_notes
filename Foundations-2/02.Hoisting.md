# Hoisting

- JS engine allocates memory to our variables and functions during creation phase before code executions starts.
- It scans through our code and allocates memory to functions and variables.
- Functions are fully hoisted.
- Variables with `var` keyword are partially hoisted as they are initialized to `undefined`.
- Variables are hoisted but there values are not copied.

## Hoisting with function execution contenxt

- Whenever a function is invoked a new execution context is created and pushed to call stack.
- Creation and execution phases happen.
- In creation phase, two objects are created which are `this` and `arguments` and then `Hoisting` happens.
- Meaning Hoisting happens in every execution context. Before function code is executed memory allocation happens.


> Our goal should be to write predictable code and hoisting creates a lot of confusion. So we must avoid it by using `let` and `const` variables instead of `var`.


## Argumesnts

- Arguments is a reserved keyword in JS which is available inside functional execution context only.
- It's an array like structure (not an array).
- We should avoid using it.
- Instead we should be using rest parameters.
