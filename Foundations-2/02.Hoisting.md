# Hoisting

- JS engine allocates memory to our variables and functions during creation phase before code executions starts.
- It scans through our code and allocates memory to functions and variables.
- Functions are fully hoisted.
- Variables with `var` keyword are partially hoisted as they are initialized to `undefined`.
- Variables are hoisted but there values are not copied.


## Arguments

- Arguments is a reserved keyword in JS which is available inside functional execution context only.
- It's an array like structure (not an array).
- We should avoid using it.
- Instead we should be using rest parameters.
