# Function scoped

- Whenever a function is invoked a new execution context is created.
- We create a new scope only when a function is called.
- So, if we write something like `if(true) { var a = 10 }`. It will get assigned to the global object. Because `var` is functionally scoped.
- We should avoid using var in loops or conditionals as it pollutes global space.
