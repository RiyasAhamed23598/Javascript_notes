# Function scoped

- Whenever a function is invoked a new execution context is created.
- We create a new scope only when a function is called.
- So, if we write something like `if(true) { var a = 10 }`. It will get assigned to the global object. Because `var` is functionally scoped.
- We should avoid using var in loops or conditionals as it pollutes global space.

# Block scope

- Variables declared with `let` and `const` are block scoped.
- They are accessible within a block only.
- Whenever JS engin enecounters {} a new scope called `block` is created.
- Once all code in the block is finished, block scope si destroyed.
