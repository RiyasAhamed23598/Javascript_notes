# Execution context

- We know how JS engine works and how our source code is converted into machine code.
- But how does JS engine executes our code.
- Every code in JS runs inside an execution context.
- Whenever a function is invoked a new execution context is created and pushed to the call stack.
- Then inside this execution context, the code starts executing.
- We can say there are two phases creation and execution. Creation creates an execution context and execution then runs our code synchronously.

## Global Execution context

- Before engine starts executing our code, it creates a `Global Execution Context` and pushes it to call stack.
- And then starts executing code line by line synchronously.
- In the creation phase, two objects are created `global object` which is `window` for browsers and `this`.
- In th execution phase code execution starts.
- Even if we have an empty JS file, still a global execution context is created as it happens before code execution starts.
