# Execution context

- We know how JS engine works and how our source code is converted into machine code.
- But how does JS engine executes our code.
- Every code in JS runs inside an execution context.

## Global Execution context

- Before engine starts executing our code, it creates a `Global Execution Context` and pushes it to call stack.
- And then starts executing code line by line synchronously.
- This global execution context gives us two objects `global object` which is `window` for browsers and `this`.
- Even if we have an empty JS file, still a global execution context is created as it happens before code execution starts.
