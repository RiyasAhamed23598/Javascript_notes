# Variables without identifiers

- When we define a variable like `user = John` without using var, let or const, It gets assigned in the global space. Even if the vraiable is declared inside a function.
- These variables are not hoisted.
- After function is removed from the call stack, variable still exists.
- This can lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior.
