# Scope

- Scope means what all data (objects, variables, functions) can we access.
- Scope consists of local scope(Variable environment) and outer scope(Lexical environment).

## Variable environment or Local scope

- Each execution context(including the global) has a variable environment.
- All the local data(objects, variables, parameters, functions) created inside an execution context is part of variable environment.

## Lexical environment

- Lexical means where something is written.
- The scope is determined just by looking at where the function is written and not where it is invoked at.
- Every execution context has access to it's variable environment plus it's lexical parent's scope.

## Scope chain

- Each execution context has access to it's local scope as well as it's outer lexical scope.
- Scope chain gives us access to our lexical parent's scope.
- Whenever we try to access a variable inside an execution context, it is first searched in it's variable environment.
- If not found, then it goes to it's lexical parent and searches for the value.
- It keeps going up the scope chain untill we encounter global object which is window for browsers.
- And then if it still can't find, it throws a reference error.
