# Scope

- Scope means what all data (objects, variables, functions) can we access.

## Variable environment or Local scope

- Each execution context(including the global) has a variable environment.
- All the local data(objects, variables, parameters, functions) created inside an execution context is part of variable environment.
- Variable environment consists of data which is local to a function or execution context and does not care about the outer scope.

## Lexical environment

- Lexical means where something is written.
- The scope is determined just by looking at where the function is written and not where it is invoked at.
- Every execution context has access to it's variable environment plus it's outer scope(lexical) based on where the function is written.
