# Execution context

## Why 

- JS engine uses execution context to execute JavaScript source code.
- It provides the environment in which the code is executed.
- Code is always executed in an environment called execution context.

## Use cases of execution context

###  1. Manages Scope and Variable Access.

- The execution context ensures that variables, functions, and objects are accessible where they are supposed to be.

### 2. Manages the "this" Keyword

- The execution context defines the value of this within a function.

### 3. Controls Code Execution Flow

- Each execution context has a call stack, which tracks the sequence of function calls.

### 4. Facilitates Lexical Environment and Closure

### 5. Supports hoisting


## Types of Execution Contexts

### Global Execution Context:

- Created when the script starts execution.

### Function Execution Context

- Created each time a function is called.
