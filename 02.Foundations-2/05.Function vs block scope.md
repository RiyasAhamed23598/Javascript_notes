# Function scoped

- We create a new scope only when a function is invoked.
- All local data(variables and functions) resides in it's own variable environment.
- We can access these variables from inside our function.
- `var` is functionally scoped.
- If we declare a variable using `var` keyword inside a block like `if` or `for` it gets allocated in the global object(window) which can cause memory leaks.

``` javascript

if (true) {
  var a = 20;
}

console.log(a); // 20

for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {}

console.log(i); // 5

```

# Block scope

- Variables declared with `let` and `const` are block scoped.
- They are accessible within a block only.
- Whenever JS engine enecounters {} a new scope called `block` is created.
- Once all code in the block is finished, block scope is destroyed.

## Exercise - 1

``` javascript

function loop() {
  for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
  console.log(i); // 5
}
loop();

```

### Explanation

`var` is functional scoped. Variable i gets allocated in the variable environment of function loop. Hence, after the loop terminates, since function is not complete yet, we can access it's variable environment.


## Exercise - 2

``` javascript

function loop() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
  console.log(i); // Reference error.
}
loop();

```

### Explanation

`let` is block scoped. After a block is finished executing, the scope is destroyed. Hence, when we try to access value of i, it's not present on the variable environment of loop. So, it looks up the scope chain, does not find anything in the global object as well and hence throws an error.
