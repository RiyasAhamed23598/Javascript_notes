# Function scoped

- We create a new scope only when a function is invoked.
- All local data(variables and functions) resides in it's own variable environment.
- We can access these variables from inside our function.
- `var` is functionally scoped.
- If we declare a variable using `var` keyword inside a block like `if` or `for` it gets allocated in the global object(window).

``` javascript

if (true) {
  var a = 20;
}

console.log(a); // 20

for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {}

console.log(i); // 5

```

# Block scope

- Variables declared with `let` and `const` are block scoped.
- They are accessible within a block only.
- Whenever JS engine enecounters {} a new scope called `block` is created.
- Once all code in the block is finished, block scope is destroyed.

## Exercise - 1

``` javascript

function loop() {
  for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
  console.log(i); // 5
}
loop();

```

### Explanation

`var` is functional scoped. Variable i gets allocated in the variable environment of function loop. Hence, after the loop terminates, since function is not complete yet, we can access it's variable environment.
