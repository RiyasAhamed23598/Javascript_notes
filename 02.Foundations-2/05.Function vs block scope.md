# Function scoped

- Whenever a function is invoked a new execution context is created.
- We create a new scope only when a function is called.
- `var` keyword is functionally scoped.
- Even if we dclare our variables inside conditionals or loops it still hold memory in the global space and won't free it after block is terminated.

# Block scope

- Variables declared with `let` and `const` are block scoped.
- They are accessible within a block only.
- Whenever JS engine enecounters {} a new scope called `block` is created.
- Once all code in the block is finished, block scope is destroyed.
