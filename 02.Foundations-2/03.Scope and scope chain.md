# Scope and Scope chain

- Every execution context has a scope which tells what all data (variables and functions) can it access.
- Scope consists of local scope as well as it's lexical parent's scope.
- For functions, local scope consists of this keyword as well.
- It doesn't matter where the function is invoked from but where it is declared that determines its scope chain.
- Whenever we try to find a variable, it is first searched in the local scope. If it is not present, then it's searched in the lexical parent's scope and so on till we reach global object.
