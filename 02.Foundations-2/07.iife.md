# IIFE

## Why do we need an IIFE

- Sometimes, we need to run some initialization code only once. We might create global variables and functions for that. But doing so we are polluting global scope even after initialization is finished.
- IIFE do not pollute the global scope.
- We can create ES6 like modules wherein we only expose necessary details and hiding others.


## How do we make them accessible to outside world

- Because that was the advantage of using global variables.
- The IIFE will return an object that will have all the properties and utility methods available.
- But we are still using a global variable. One variable which has all the data instead of multiple.
