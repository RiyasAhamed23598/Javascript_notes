# IIFE

## Why do we need an IIFE

- Function is not created in global object as it's not a function decaration. Sometimes we declare a function invoke it and don't need it again. But that function still remains in the global space.
- We can create private properties.


## How do we make them accessible to outside world

- Because that was the advantage of using global variables.
- The IIFE will return an object that will have all the properties and utility methods available.
- But we are still using a global variable. One variable which has all the data instead of multiple.
