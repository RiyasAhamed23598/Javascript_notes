# Lexical Environment/Scope

- Scope means what all data (objects, variables, functions) can we access.
- Lexical means where something is written.
- Lexical scope means that scope is determined by where a function is written and not where it is invoked(dynamic scoping).
- Compilers can decide the scope by just looking at where a function is written.
