# Hoisting

- JS engine allocates memory to our variables and functions during creation phase before code executions starts.
- It scans through our code and allocates memory to functions and variables.
- So, when our code xecutes, we already have the variables and functions in memory. No fresh allocation is done.
- Functions are fully hoisted.
- Variables with `var` keyword are partially hoisted as they are initialized to `undefined`.
- Variables are hoisted but there values are not copied.
- By the time our code runs, variables and functions are already loaded in the memory. During execution there values are just updated.
