# Hoisting

- Happens during creation phase of execution context before the code execution.
- Memory allocation happens for the variables and functions during creation phase even before the code starts executing.
- During the execution phase, we are just assigning values to variables that are already preset in the memory, or invoke functions which are already there in the memory.
- Variables are partially hoisted. We allocate them the memory but do not assign a value. They are asigned `undefined`.
- Function declarations are fully hoisted.
