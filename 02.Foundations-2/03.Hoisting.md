# Hoisting

- Happens during creation phase of execution context before the code execution.
- Memory allocation happens for the variables and functions during creation phase even before the code starts executing.
- JS engine skims through our code and decides that we will need memory for these variables and functions so it allocates memory even before code execution starts.
- During the execution phase, we are just assigning values to variables that are already preset in the memory, or invoke functions which are already there in the memory.
- As a result, we are able to access variables and functions even before declaring them because they are already there in the memory.
- Variables are partially hoisted. We allocate them the memory but do not assign a value. They are asigned `undefined`.
- Function declarations are fully hoisted but function expressions are not.

## Exercises

## Exercise - 1

```javascript

var one = 1;
var one = 2;

console.log(one);

```
### Explanation

The answer would be 2. Before code execution we allocate memory to variable one and assign a value of `undefined`. During execution, the value of memory is updated to 1 and then 2.


## Exercise - 2

```javascript

a();

function a() {
  console.log("Hi");
}

function a() {
  console.log("Bye");
}

```
### Explanation

The answer would be bye. Since, JS is synchronous first it allocates memory for the first function and a refers to that location. Then it encounters another function, the memory location will be updated.
