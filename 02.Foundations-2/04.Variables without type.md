# Variables without identifiers

- We declare our variables with either `var`, `let` or `const`. What if we omit these prefix.
- When we define a variable like `user = John` without using any prefix, It gets assigned in the global space always, Even if the vraiable is declared inside a function or block scoped like loops or conditional.
- These variables are not hoisted.
- After function or block is removed from the call stack, variable still exists.
- This can lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior.
- We can use `use strict` to avoid this pitfall.
