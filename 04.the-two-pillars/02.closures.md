# Closures

- A closure gives a function access to its outer scope.
- Even after the outer functions leaves the scope(canb be due to web apis or function returning functions) in which it was declared, inner function still remembers it.
- This is important because, when a function completes it is poped out of stack and it's scope is destroyed. But still inner function has access to it.
- No garbage collection happens as a function is still referencing those varaiables.

## Advantages of using closures

## Data encapsulation and privacy

- Closures allow you to create private variables within a function scope.
- Data and methods interested in that data are present together in one capsule.
