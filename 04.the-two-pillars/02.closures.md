# Closures

- A closure gives a function access to its outer scope even after it leaves the scope in which it was declared.
- Even if we return a function from a function and call it later, it still can access it's outer scope.
- Normally, when a function execution is completed, it get's popped out of call stack and it's scope is destroyed.
- But, because inner function is still referencing a variable from outer scope, they are not garbage collected but stored in a closure.
- If we are not accessing variables or functions from outer scope, no closure is formed.
- Where we write the function matters not where we invoke it.

## Advantages of using closures

## Data encapsulation and privacy

- Closures allow you to create private variables within a function scope.
- Data and methods interested in that data are present together in one capsule.
