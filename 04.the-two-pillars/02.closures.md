# Closures

- A closure gives a function access to its outer scope.
- Even if we return a function from a function and call it later, it still can access it's outer scope.
- Normally, when a function execution is completed, it get's popped out of call stack and it's scope is destroyed.
- But, because inner function is still referencing a variable from outer scope, they are not garbage collected but stored in a closure.
