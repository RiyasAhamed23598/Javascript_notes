# Closures

- A closure gives a function access to its outer scope.
- Even after the outer function is popped out of the call stack, it's variables are not garbage collected because inner function is referencing them.
- If inner function is not accessing outer scope, then no closure is formed.
- This is possible because of lexical scoping. Even before code excutes, JS engine knows what function has what scope and scope chain. Where functions are invoked does not matter. Where they are wriiten is important.
