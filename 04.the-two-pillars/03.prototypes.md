# Prototypal inheritence

- Inheritence means an object wants to access properties and methods of some other object.
- This is useful because we can create one shared object in the memory which can have all the utility functions like map, filter, reduce and then every object created can access the shared object in the memory.
- Array.prototype, Object.prototype, String.prototype, Number.prototype, Function.prototype they all create a shared object in the memory.
- Now whenever we define a type in JS, JS engine establishes a link to it's shared object in memory using __proto__. It assigns proto to the parent.prototype.
- This is how utility methods are shared across all instances of arrays, objects, numbers, strings, etc.
- It's like all our types gets a reference to a shared piece of code.

## Prototype chain

- Since every object has a hidden __proto__, this shared object that we create will also have a reference. For arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, function this referes to Object.prototype.
- That is why we say, everything is JS is an object.
- For object.prototype, this will refer to null which means end of chain.
- So, every method is first searched in its own scope, then shared scope, then shared scope of its parent and son on.
