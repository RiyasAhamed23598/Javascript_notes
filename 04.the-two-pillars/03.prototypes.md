# Prototypal inheritence

- Inheritence means an object wanys to access properties and methods of some other object.
- When we assign our variables a value (primitive or reference) we get bunch of utility methods available like on array we have map, filter, reduce etc.
- But we did not explicity write their implementations.
- How does JS provides us with the utility methods.
- Everything in js is an object. Because whatever type we use we have a class for that. Array, Object, Number, String, Boolean. Whenever we declare any type in JS, we are creating instance of it's base class.
- Since JS does not supports classical inheritence, how does every instance shares utility methods?
- Every base class has a property called prototype. Array.prototype.
