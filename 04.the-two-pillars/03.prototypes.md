# Prototypal inheritence

- Inheritence means an object wanys to access properties and methods of some other object.
- When we assign our variables a value (primitive or reference) we get bunch of utility methods available like on array we have map, filter, reduce etc.
- But we did not explicity write their implementations.
- How does JS provides us with the utility methods.
