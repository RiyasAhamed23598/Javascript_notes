# Prototypal inheritence

- Constructor functions like Array, Object, Function, String, Number, Boolean help us create objects.
- We want all the instances created to have access to some shared utility methods.
- We can define utilities on ConstructorFunction.prototype = utils;
- When we create an object, JS engine will give us access to this prototype using a hidden keyword __ proto __. It refers to the prototype defibed on constructor function.
- When we create an instance, on instance we do not have the utility methods but we have a __ proto __ which refers to the prototype.
- This is how we get access to utility methods.

## Prototype chain

- Since every object has a hidden __proto__, this shared object that we create will also have a reference. For arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, function this referes to Object.prototype.
- That is why we say, everything is JS is an object.
- For object.prototype, this will refer to null which means end of chain.
- So, every method is first searched in its own scope, then shared scope, then shared scope of its parent and son on.
