# Prototypal inheritence

- Inheritence means an object wants to access properties and methods of some other object.
- This is useful because we can create one object in the memory which can have all the utility functions like map, filter, reduce and then every object can access the same object in the memory.
- Array.prototype, Object.prototype, String.prototype, Number.prototype, Function.prototype they all crate a shared object in the memory.
- Now whenever we define a type in JS, JS engine establishes a link to it's shared object in memory using __proto__.
- This is how utility methods are shared across all instances of arrays, objects, numbers, strings, etc.
