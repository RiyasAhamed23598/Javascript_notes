# Functions

- Functions are special type of objects., a callable object
- We are able to access methods like `call`, `apply`, `bind` and some properties like `name`, `length`.


## First class citizens

- Since functions are objects. We can pass them as arguments, return them from a function like we can do with an object.
- Functions are first class citizens in JS. It means 3 things.
- Functions can be assigned to variables or object property.
- Pass a function as an argument to another function.
- We can return functions as value from other functions.


## Higher order functions

- A Higher Order Function (HOF) is a function that either takes a function as an argument or returns another function.
- Map, filter, reduce, setTimeout etc.
- Provide function with some custom logic to be executed. Parent function decides when to execute it.
