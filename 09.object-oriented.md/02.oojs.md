# Object oriented programming

- Every real world entity is represented by an object which has properties(attributes) and behaviors.
- Example: A car has properties like `color`, `brand`, and `speed`, and behaviors like `drive` and `brake`. In OOP, this car can be modeled as an object in code.

# Key Principles

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
