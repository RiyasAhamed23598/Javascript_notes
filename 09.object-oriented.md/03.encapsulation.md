# Encapsulation

- Bundling data (properties) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit, typically a class or an object.
- It also involves restricting direct access to some components, which is often implemented using access modifiers like `private`, `protected`, or `public`.

## Encapsulation Using Closures

``` javascript
function BankAccount(initialBalance) {
    let balance = initialBalance; // Private variable

    return {
        deposit(amount) {
            if (amount > 0) balance += amount;
        },
        withdraw(amount) {
            if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) balance -= amount;
        },
        getBalance() {
            return balance; // Only accessible through this method
        }
    };
}

const account = BankAccount(100);
account.deposit(50);
account.withdraw(30);
console.log(account.getBalance()); // 120

// Direct access to `balance` is not possible
console.log(account.balance); // undefined

```
