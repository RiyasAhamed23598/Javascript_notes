# Inheritence

- Allows a class to access properties and methods of a parent classs.
- Inheritence removes code duplication and helps with memory efficiency as common properties and methods are defined in the memory once and not on all the instances.
- In JavaScript, inheritance can be implemented using ES6 classes with the extends keyword, as well as the prototype chain.

## Inheritance Using ES6 Classes

``` javascript
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    constructor(name, breed) {
        super(name); // Calls the constructor of the parent class
        this.breed = breed;
    }

    speak() {
        // Overriding the speak method
        console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
    }
}

const dog = new Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever");
dog.speak(); // Buddy barks.

const animal = new Animal("Generic Animal");
animal.speak(); // Generic Animal makes a noise.

```

##  Multilevel Inheritance

``` javascript
class LivingBeing {
    breathe() {
        console.log("Breathing...");
    }
}

class Mammal extends LivingBeing {
    feedMilk() {
        console.log("Feeding milk...");
    }
}

class Human extends Mammal {
    speak() {
        console.log("Speaking...");
    }
}

const person = new Human();
person.breathe(); // Inherited from LivingBeing
person.feedMilk(); // Inherited from Mammal
person.speak(); // Defined in Human

```
