## First class citizens

- Functions are first class citizens in JavaScript.
- Functions are objects in JS. Which means they can be passed around like our regular types.
- Functions can be assigned to variables and properties of an object.
- We can pass functions into argument to some other function.
- We can return functions as values from other functions.
