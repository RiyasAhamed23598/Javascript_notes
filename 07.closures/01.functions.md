# Functions

## First class citizens

- Functions are first class citizens in JavaScript.
- Functions are objects in JS. Which means they can be passed around like our regular types.
- Functions can be assigned to variables and properties of an object.
- We can pass functions into argument to some other function.
- We can return functions as values from other functions.

``` javascript
// 1. Assigning functions to variables.
const greetUser = function () {};

// 2. Pass functions as arguments.
function greet(cb) {
  cb();
}

greet(function () {
  console.log("Hello User");
});

// 3. Return functions as value.
function greetUser() {
  return function () {
    console.log("Hello user");
  };
}

greetUser()();

```

## Higher order functions

- A function that takes a function as an argument or returns a function.
- Using HOF, we can create generic functions and during invokation we decide what data to use and what logic.
