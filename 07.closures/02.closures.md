# Closures

- A function is able to retain access to its outer (enclosing) scope, even after that scope has finished executing.

``` javascript
function a() {
  let grandpa = "grandpa";

  return function b() {
    let parent = "parent";

    return function c() {
      let son = "son";
      console.log(`${grandpa} > ${parent} > ${son}`);
    };
  };
}

a()()();

```

- Both a and b have finished executing and are removed from call stack. Even then, c remembers the outser scope.
