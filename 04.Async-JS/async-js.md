# Asynchronous programming

- In synchronous programming, tasks are executed one after another. If one task takes a long time, it blocks the subsequent tasks.
- In asynchronous programming, a task that takes time to complete (e.g., fetching data from a server) does not block the execution of other tasks.

## Mechanisms for Asynchronous Programming

- Callbacks
- Promises
- Async await
