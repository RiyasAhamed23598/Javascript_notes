# Job Queue

- Before promises, all async tasks were managed by Web api's and callback queue (also called task queue).
- Handling async code was not natively part of JavaScript but Web Api's.
- After promises, now JS could handle async tasks natively.
- So, a new queue was introduced which is called Job queue or Microtask queue.
- It has a higher priority than callback or task queue.
- It means, the event loop first check the job queue and then the callback queue.

``` javascript
// 1 Callback Queue ~ Task Queue
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("1", "is the loneliest number");
}, 0);
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("2", "can be as bad as one");
}, 10);

// 2 Job Queue ~ Microtask Queue
Promise.resolve("hi").then(data => console.log("2", data));

// 3
console.log("3", "is a crowd");

// 3 is a crowd
// 2 hi
// undefined Promise resolved
// 1 is the loneliest number
// 2 can be as bad as one
```
