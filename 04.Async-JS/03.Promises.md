# Promises

- The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
- It always produces a single value only.
- A Promise is in one of these states.
- `pending`: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected. Async operation has just started.
- `fulfilled`: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
- `rejected`: meaning that the operation failed.


## How to create a Promise

``` javascript

const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // async operation
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("I have completed");
  }, 2000);
});

promise.then((data) => {
  console.log(data);
});

```
