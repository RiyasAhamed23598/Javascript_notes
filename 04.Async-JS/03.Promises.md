# Promises

- The `Promise` object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
- It always produces a single value only.
- A `Promise` is in one of these states.
- `pending`: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected. Async operation has just started.
- `fulfilled`: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
- `rejected`: meaning that the operation failed.
