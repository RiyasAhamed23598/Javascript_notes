# Promise.all

## Why

- We want to wait for multiple asynchronous operations to complete before proceeding.


## What

- It is a method that takes iterable of promises as input and returns a single Promise.
- The returned promise fulfils when all of the input promises fulfil.
- The promise fulfils with an array of values in the same order as input irrrespective of the completion order.
