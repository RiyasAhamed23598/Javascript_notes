# Promise.all

## Why

- We want to wait for multiple asynchronous operations to complete before proceeding.
- We can then aggregate the results and can work with the results collectively.


## What

- It is a method that takes iterable of promises as input and returns a single Promise.
- The returned promise fulfils when all of the input promises fulfil.
- The promise fulfils with an array of values in the same order as input irrespective of the completion order.
- The promise rejects if any one of the input promises reject with th value of that rejected promise.

``` javascript
Promise.all([asyncTask1(), asyncTask2(), asyncTask3()])
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```
