# Asynchronous programming

- In synchronous programming, tasks are executed one after another. If one task takes a long time, it blocks the subsequent tasks.
- In asynchronous programming, a task that takes time to complete (e.g., fetching data from a server) does not block the execution of other tasks.
- Any long running task, should be executed in a way that it does not block the main thread and freezez our webpage.
- We generally do not know how much time these async tasks might take.
- But we want to execute some code after an async task is completed. This is done using callbacks, promises and async await.

## Mechanisms for Asynchronous Programming

- Callbacks
- Promises
- Async await
