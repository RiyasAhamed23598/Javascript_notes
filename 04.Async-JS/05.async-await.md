# Async await

## Why

## 1. Readability and maintainability

- With callbacks and promises, we could end up with deeply nested code which can lead to callback hell or multi level method chains.
- This can make our code hard to read and debug.
- Moreover, JS is synchronous in nature.
- So, async/await allows you to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous, making it more readable and easier to maintain.
