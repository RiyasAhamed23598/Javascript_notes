# Callbacks

- We want to execute some code after an async operation has completed. But we do not know when that async operation will complete.
- So, we pass a function as argument to a function that is performing async task.
- And once the async task completes, we invoke the function.

``` javascript

function fetchData(callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Data fetched");
        callback();
    }, 2000); // Simulate a delay
}

fetchData(() => {
    console.log("Processing data...");
});

```
