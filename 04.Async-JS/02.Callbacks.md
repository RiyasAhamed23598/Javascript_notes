# Callbacks

- We want to execute some code after an async operation has completed. But we do not know when that async operation will complete.
- So, we have a function that is performing an async task.
- Once the async task completes, we ask it to execute a function that we pass as an argument.

``` javascript

function fetchData(callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Data fetched");
        callback();
    }, 2000); // Simulate a delay
}

fetchData(() => {
    console.log("Processing data...");
});

```

## Callback hell

- If we want to perform multiple asynchronous tasks in a sequential manner, we get deeply nested callbacks called callback hell.

``` javascript

asyncTask1(() => {
    asyncTask2(() => {
        asyncTask3(() => {
            console.log("Done!");
        });
    });
});

```
